# The Winning Resume Package

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand how to create a successful resume that will get noticed

* Communicate your GA experience effectively on your resume 

* Organize content on your resume to tell the story of your career transition

* Create a draft resume 


## Framing: 

We know that you likely don’t know yet what you want to do or where to even begin with your resume; that’s okay! Our goal today is to show you what success looks like, and to get your content into a draft that you can continue to work on throughout the course.

## Resume Essentials

**The secret six:**

1. Your resume should be an advertisement – not an autobiography

2. Write for the reader – not yourself

3. Make it easy to be screened in – not out

4. Tell them only what they want to hear

5. Give proof – not promises

6. One size does NOT fit all situations

Do your research - your resume is your personal advertisement

**The format:**

1. Introduction (centered): Name, phone number, email, location (just city, state), link to portfolio

2. Brand Statement (centered) {You do not need to label it as "Brand Statement"}

3. Skills (List your hard skills - tools, languages, programming)

4. Relevant Experience:

    1. General Assembly XX IMMERSIVE Experience + description

    2. Projects

    3. Any other experience related to data science

5. Professional Experience

    4. List chronologically

6. Education

    5. List GA again, but without a description

7. Side Hustle/hobbies/personal interests/awards (optional)

    6. Anything else that you are really proud of that you’d like to share
